# Rope

This project started because I wanted a way of managing my RPG sessions,
play sounds, visualize RPG documents, roll dices... Everything you would
expect from a RPG session.

When I first started it, I was drived for a specific implemetation for
my RPG, so now I am re-working it to be more generalized, so others can
use this tool as well.
